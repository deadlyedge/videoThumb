# purpose

This is a simple local video tool designed to help you organize videos efficiently. It serves as a handy reference, especially when dealing with a large number of video files that are difficult to describe using filenames or other textual or language-based descriptors. To ensure the final PDF document is visually appealing and easy to read, the tool generates up to 16 thumbnails by default. The resulting PDF is labeled for easy navigation and searching.
